# Pomodoro timer
## Pomodoro timer python app with a high score for most amount of time
This python gui app made with ttkbootstrap helps you with work and study by counting down a 25 min "work" period, and when it finishes a "rest" period of 5 min starts. 
This period loops 4 times, after the 4th "work" period a 25 min "rest" period starts and the loop restarts all over again

### This is a modified version of a pomodoro timer

This version includes a high score that tracks how many hours of work you did in the week
This feature motivates you to put more hours into your projects
You have a "best lap" record for most amounts of hours of work in one day
and a high score for most amount of hours in a week
Your week timer resets on the same week day of wich you first launched the app, making sure that app is consistent and engages you to keep using it
